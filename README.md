### This dashboard is designed to provide insights into Olympic data. It features a user-friendly interface with drop-down menus for selecting teams and years to visualize the data. The dashboard includes visualizations such as a bar chart of medal type distribution and a line chart showing age distribution. Additionally, scorecards display the count of gold, silver, and bronze medals for each team.
